### - Story -

とあるヴィクトリア朝に、ほとんどすべての家は「メイド」を雇った。でも町はよくモンスターに攻撃されたら、
メイドは家事を切り盛りするだけでなく、家を守るのために戦わなければならない。そんなことはメイドの義務だ。
最近、「伝説の復活箒」という噂がある…

初めまして、5argon です! (@5argondesu)無名銭12でBMS製作を始めて、今回は初めてBoFに参加します。
僕はタイ人だから多分英語コメントの方はもっと詳しいです! (すみません)

この曲の話題は「アニメOPっぽい曲が作ってみたい...」それではこんな曲が出た!

I wanted to make a song that sounded like an anime's OP,
(I liked Nana Mizuki's music producer!) so this song turned out like there should
be a lyric, but of course I could not compose lyric, So I let the violin and
brass instruments sing for me.

I practiced using slap bass in this song. I hope you enjoyed hearing them!

I was a big fan of DJMAX games, since I played DJMAX Portable Black Square,
I have always wondered how can you make a music animation like that? I wanted to be
able to make them one day, both music and animation. I wanted to inspire players,
like I once being so addicted to songs like ESTi's Oblivion, for example.

Many years later, I notice BOFU is the perfect opportunity to realize that dream.
As I compose, I also imagined how would I make the scene at the same time.
This story is called "Maid Battle". (めっちゃ変だ)

As the song I wanted it to sound like anime's OP, I add some anime-style elements
in the BGA, like logo appearing after panning to the sky! (This is so lame!)

With nice artwork from fellow Thai music gamer Kikansha that I could never draw
by myself, I finally able to animate my very first music game animation with characters
and story! As an animator, I am really happy to see her character moves around and
became alive even though before it is just a still image.

Ps. あの約6秒弾幕シーンを作るのは3時間かかった (大変!)

Making a notechart for this song is challenging. It’s because this song
has a lot of interesting parts at the same time.

As a Jazz Fusion song, it has many interesting instruments, for example,
slap bass, piano, synth, effects, and violins.

It’s hard to select which instrument to play at which time. Therefore, I also
included a special [RANDOMIZER] chart.

This chart is randomized, so that it selects different instruments each time
you play.

But I made sure that every combination has the same number of notes, so that
each combination has the same maximum EX-SCORE.

I hope you enjoyed these charts!

## Kikansha

Hi! This is Kikansha. I'm the storyboard artist and the main illustrator of
this song.

First of all, I would like to thank my teammate 5argon for this opportunity.
I always have a dream to be part of rhythm gaming industry as a BGA illustrator
since I was a huge fan of DJMAX (in fact, we know each other and also other
members by this game ww) so this work might be considered as the first step
of a long journey to my life target.

About the BGA. It's really fun to draw maids. I always love those adorable
maid costumes (but I'll never try to wear them ... JUST NEVER!) While making
the arts, I've come through such hard times because I still have my own 'battle'
with a thesis and a freelance job at the same time, but when the BGA is finished,
I feel like my energy has been fully revived again ww.

Although I did most of the illustrations in this song, there's a scene that I
got a little help from A_Cen on drawing. Thank you for providing me a
huge monster illustration (I'm not so good in drawing monsters or some strange
creatures ;w;).

I wish you enjoy the BGA which I participated for the first time!

## DJPop

Hi, DJPop's here.

I created notecharts for many music games, but it's my first time
creating BMS for BOF event.

To participate in such a grand event is a great opportunity for me.
I hope you enjoy them.

You can find my other works here.
